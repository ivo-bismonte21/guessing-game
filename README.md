# guessing-game
An application of my learning in JavaScript creating a guessing game.

This is a general application of what I learned in the fundamentals of Javascript. A bit of HTML and CSS, but still polishing it, especially in css. The project is self-explanatory on the repo name itself. It requires a user to guess a number from 1 to 100. This project introduced me on the basics of javascript and what magics can you do with it.

This project is also my first ever repository because I'm learning on how to use Github hehe.
